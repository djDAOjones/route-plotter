# UI Standards

This file contains the full UI, usability, and accessibility rules for
the project. `AGENTS.md` references this file. Read it before any task
that touches UI, controls, layout, text, states, accessibility, or
user-facing behaviour.

## Design system

IBM Carbon Design System is the **reference standard** for this
project. Carbon is not installed as a package dependency. All UI
components are implemented in the project's own code to match Carbon's
productive design language: component anatomy, interaction behaviour,
spacing, sizing, and visual conventions.

### Carbon-first UI discipline

- Prefer Carbon components, patterns, tokens, spacing, and interaction
  conventions wherever a suitable Carbon solution exists. Do not invent
  a custom control if Carbon already provides an appropriate one.
- Use Carbon's **productive** UI style for the working interface, not
  expressive or marketing styling.
- Use semantic design tokens for colour, spacing, typography, layer,
  border, and state. Do not hard-code ad hoc UI values unless there is
  no suitable tokenised equivalent.
- Keep layouts modular, consistent, and task-focused. Reuse an existing
  Carbon pattern before creating a new one.
- Where Carbon defaults meet AA but not this project's stricter AAA
  target, adapt them. Carbon is the baseline, not the ceiling.

### Token systems

Two token systems run side by side:

| System | Governs | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Okabe-Ito palette** | Map data colours (markers, paths, beacons, area highlights) | `styles/tokens.css` as `--map-series-*` and enforced by `SwatchPicker.js` |
| **UoN semantic tokens** | UI chrome (surfaces, text, borders, interactive states) | `styles/tokens.css` as `--surface-*`, `--text-*`, `--border-*`, etc. |

Carbon conventions (spacing scale, typography scale, layout grid, layer
tokens, border tokens, interaction state tokens) are implemented to
match Carbon spec using the UoN semantic tokens as the colour source.

Do not collapse one system into the other. Map data colours must always
use Okabe-Ito (colour-blind safe). UI chrome must always use UoN
semantic tokens.

## Usability heuristics

Nielsen's heuristics are **hard rules**, not aspirations.

### Content and form (Carbon rules)

- **Sentence case** for all UI text.
- Every input must have a visible label. No colons after labels.
- Visible label text must match the accessible name.
- Labels: concise, 1–3 words where practical.
- Helper text only when it prevents error, clarifies format, or
  explains consequence.
- Prefer native HTML form controls before custom ARIA widgets.
- Use user language, not implementation terms.

### System status

- Every async action must show status: loading, progress, success,
  or error. The UI must never appear frozen.
- Important status changes must be announced programmatically, not
  only shown visually.
- Auto-save, export, import, and recovery states must be visible.

### Empty and no-data states

- Every panel must have an intentional empty state explaining what
  belongs here and what to do next.
- Distinguish "nothing yet," "filtered out," "failed to load," and
  "not available." No blank panels or silent failures.
- Loading states must preserve layout stability — no content jumps.

### User control and freedom

- Provide cancel, undo, or back-out routes for non-trivial actions.
- Destructive actions require confirmation or reliable undo.
- Do not trap users in modes, overlays, or incomplete flows.

### Consistency

- Same words, icons, patterns, and spacing for the same concepts
  throughout. Do not create synonyms for existing concepts.
- Follow existing Carbon conventions and established design tokens.

### Error prevention and recovery

- Constrain invalid input, validate early, disable impossible actions.
- Prefer safe defaults. No silent propagation of invalid states.
- Error messages must say what happened and what to do next.
- Errors must be specific, human-readable, and linked to the relevant
  control. No vague "Something went wrong" without actionable detail.

### Recognition over recall

- Keep key controls visible. Show current selection, mode, and state
  explicitly. Surface context near the point of action.
- Slider readouts show the value the renderer or timeline consumes, never an
  internal slider coordinate. Name the unit or direction in the visible
  readout, connect that readout with `aria-describedby`, and keep
  `aria-valuetext` synchronized when the control uses a translated scale.
- Renderer-scaled size controls use pixel readouts and say in contextual help
  that the value is calibrated at the renderer's reference size. SCALE-01 owns
  any future change to that sizing model.

### Flexibility and efficiency

- Support novice and repeat use. Expose shortcuts for common actions.
- Provide click, tap, and keyboard alternatives — avoid drag-only
  interactions.

### Minimalist design

- Keep interfaces lean and task-relevant. No decorative chrome,
  redundant copy, or competing calls to action.
- Complex inspector cards keep 2–4 conceptual controls for the shortest
  complete task visible in `.section-primary`. Secondary refinements use one
  native `details.section-more` disclosure labelled `More`; compact cards do
  not render an empty tier, and prerequisites never move behind it.

### Motion discipline

- Motion must be subtle, purposeful, and easy to ignore.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. No motion as the only carrier
  of meaning. No content flashing more than 3 times per second.

### Help and contextual guidance

- Provide contextual help (tooltips, helper text, inline guidance)
  for non-obvious controls and workflows.
- Help content must be task-focused, concrete, and brief.

## Accessibility — WCAG 2.2 AAA by default

Target **WCAG 2.2 AAA** for all applicable UI. Document exceptions
explicitly. Where a criterion cannot reasonably apply, record it in
implementation notes.

### Perceivable

- Text contrast: **7:1** (large text may use **4.5:1** where WCAG
  permits).
- Do not rely on colour alone for state, status, or meaning.
- Link text must make sense on its own — no "click here."
- Use headings and landmarks for substantial content. Provide text
  alternatives for meaningful non-text content.

### Operable

- All functionality must be keyboard operable without traps.
- Focus order must be logical. Focus indicators must be visible and
  not obscured by sticky headers or overlays.
- Pointer targets: **≥ 44 × 44 CSS px** unless a WCAG exception
  applies.
- Do not require path-based gestures or fine motor precision when a
  simpler alternative exists.
- Provide pause/stop/hide for moving or auto-updating content.
- Warn before timeouts that could cause data loss.

### Understandable

- Predictable behaviour. No unexpected context changes on focus or
  input.
- Form instructions and validation near the relevant control.
- Visible labels and accessible names must match for speech input.

### Robust

- Semantic HTML before ARIA. No ARIA is better than bad ARIA.
- Dynamic updates (loading, validation, errors) exposed
  programmatically. Custom widgets must expose role, name, value,
  and state correctly.

## Design review gate

Before sign-off on any UI-affecting change, verify:

1. Which Carbon component or pattern this change follows.
2. Why a custom pattern was necessary if Carbon was not used.
3. Which Nielsen heuristics were most at risk.
4. Text contrast meets **7:1** for normal text and **4.5:1** for large
   text where permitted.
5. Focus order, focus visibility, and focus non-obscuration still work.
6. All pointer targets meet **44 × 44 CSS px** unless a documented WCAG
   exception applies.
7. Visible labels match accessible names.
8. Link text is self-describing without surrounding context.
9. Empty, loading, success, validation, and error states were all
   considered and are not visual-only.
10. Keyboard, pointer, and assistive-technology routes all still work.
11. Motion can be reduced or disabled where non-essential.
12. Critical submissions or destructive actions support validation,
    confirmation, undo, or reversal as appropriate.
13. Any exception to the AAA-by-default rule is documented explicitly.
